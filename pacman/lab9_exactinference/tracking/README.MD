You will notice that this pacman is very different from others! He is the one that hunts down the ghosts! The course suggests that this is a mark of pacman's distant past, being hunter before he became hunted. As you run the code, you'll notice that he becomes increasingly good at hunting down ghosts. Originally, he's bumbling around in the dark, but slowly he becomes faster and faster at finding the ghosts and eliminating them. Yeesh!
