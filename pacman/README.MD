Berkeley CS188 Pacman AI
====================================
Hi! This folder includes my work on Berkeley's CS188 Pacman AI class. Note that the project is incomplete; I look forward to finishing it when my courseload affords me the time.

Labs 1-9 mark ascending levels of complexity in the AI. Due to limitations on Github's uploading capacities, Lab9 is the only one that I've been able to upload the testing metrics to. I suggest you use that folder to guage my skills in Artificial Intelligence.

If you'd like to download an individual folder from a Github repository, you start by navigating to https://download-directory.github.io/. In the prompted box, type https://github.com/gzsrahman/artificial-intelligence-projects/tree/main/pacman/lab9_exactinference/tracking. Once the folder is downloaded, place it into your desired location on your device.

To run the file, you can run the following commands:
python autograder.py -q q1
python autograder.py -q q2
python autograder.py -q q3
python autograder.py -q q4

You will notice that this pacman is very different from others! He is the one that hunts down the ghosts! The course suggests that this is a mark of pacman's distant past, being hunter before he became hunted. As you run the code, you'll notice that he becomes increasingly good at hunting down ghosts. Originally, he's bumbling around in the dark, but slowly he becomes faster and faster at finding the ghosts and eliminating them. Yeesh!
